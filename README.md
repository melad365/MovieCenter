# Movie Centre

This is the repository for my final year project.
It is an movie recommender system built with and android application that allows users to view movie information after registration and login. They can view movies that are upcoming, in cinemas, popular etc etc. The system takes in all the data of their movie preferences by means of a star rating. This information is stored in Googles firebase and from there a python script recommends movies that it sees fit for the user.
